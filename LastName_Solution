As there is a problem in the AssignmentFive File is that as we are starting the both thread simuntaneously 
so both thread will have access to the method so at the time of input taking there will be a chances of input match.
so there are chances that both thread will access to the method at the same time so data consistency issue will be
there. 

so to avoid it, we can use wait and notifyAll method which will work as second thread will finish its work and 
when first thread finishes its work, we will call notifyAll so that second thread will awake and starts its 
execution.
